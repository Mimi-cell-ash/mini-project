# JavaScript Fundamentals Practice

This is a beginner JavaScript practice project focused on building a strong foundation in core programming concepts.  
The project runs in the browser console and demonstrates logical thinking using plain JavaScript.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is divided into stages, each practicing a specific JavaScript concept:

- Number analysis (even/odd, positive/negative/zero)
- String analysis (length categorization)
- Math operations (square, square root, random number generation)
- Boolean logic using conditional statements

All logic is written in JavaScript without functions or DOM manipulation to strengthen understanding of fundamentals.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Variables
- Numbers and math operations
- Strings and string properties
- Boolean logic
- `if / else` statements
- Logical operators (`&&`)
- Template literals
- `Math` methods (`Math.sqrt`, `Math.random`, `Math.floor`)
